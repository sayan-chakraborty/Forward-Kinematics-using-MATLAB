# Forward Kinematics implementation (2D and 3D) using MATLAB

Forward kinematics refers to the use of the kinematic equations of a robot to compute the position of the end-effector from specified values for the joint parameters. In this mini-project, I have implemented forward kinematics using MATLAB for a 3 D.O.F (2D) and a 4 D.O.F (3D) arm simulated in MATLAB.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository in order to run the MATLAB files. 

The structure of the repository is shown as below:
```

└───src
│   │   2-D Forward Kinematics 3DOF.m
│   │   3-D_Forward_Kinematics_4DOF.m

```

### Prerequisites

Ensure that MATLAB is installed in your local PC.
